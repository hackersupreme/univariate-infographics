## Documentation

The component library resides in the `src` folder while an example react app that uses the library resides in the `example` folder. The example react app is a very simple app that displays all the components in a column.

Each component in the library only requires one attribute to work, the `data` prop. It takes in an array of objects that contains the data the component will render. The objects in the array must have a `value` property that contains a number. They can have any number of other properties as well.

```
const data = [
  {
    value: 1
  },
  {
    value: 2
  }
]

...

<PieChart data={data} />
```

Each component has a number of other props you can pass to it, including `width`, `height`, and `baseColor`. For full documentation on all the props available for each component, see the [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/univariate-infographics) for the library.
