## How To Use Library

[Instructions for use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/univariate-infographics)

## Components

This is a library of reusable react components that displays data as svg info-graphics. Here are all the components in the library:

- `<PieChart data={data} />`
- `<PieSlice data={data} />`
- `<BarChart data={data} />`
- `<HorizontalBar data={data} />`
- `<VerticalBar data={data} />`

## Documentation

The component library resides in the `src` folder while an example react app that uses the library resides in the `example` folder. The example is a very simple app that displays all the components in a column.

Each component in the library only requires one attribute to work, the `data` prop. It takes in an array of objects that contains the data the component will render. The objects in the array must have a `value` property that contains a number. They can have any number of other properties as well.

```
const data = [
  {
    value: 1
  },
  {
    value: 2
  }
]

// OR

const data = [
  {
    value: 1,
    label: 'A',
    unit: 'x',
    ...
  },
  {
    value: 2,
    label: 'B',
    unit: 'x',
    ...
  }
]

// BOTH WORK IN THE COMPONENT BELOW

...

<PieChart data={data} />
```

All components have a corresponding function that will take the data and calculate the individual parts of a component which are rendered by a sub-component. Those functions return an array of updated objects with all the information they need for the sub-components. For example, the `BarChart` component uses a function called `createBars` to create the individual `Bar` components of the bar chart. 

Each component has a number of other props you can pass to it, including `width`, `height`, and `baseColor`. For full documentation on all the props available for each component and what they do, see the [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/univariate-infographics) for the library.

```
<PieChart
  data={data}
  width={500}
  height={500}
  baseColor={'rgb(255,0,0)'}
/>
```
